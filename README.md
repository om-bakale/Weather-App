## 🌦 Weather App Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript 🌐

🚀 I built a clean and responsive Weather App that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app is simple yet elegant, with emoji-enhanced UI, smooth styling, and useful features like:

✅ Live temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions
✅ Dynamic weather icons and emoji representations ☀ 🌧 ❄
✅ Local storage to remember your last searched city
✅ Enter key support and responsive layout
